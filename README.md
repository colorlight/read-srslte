# read-srslte
### What I am going to do
I'm going to read the ue part of the srslte.

### Why do I do this
* To understand the basic architecture of LTE Baseband code.
* To learn the implement of the LTE Baseband code.
* To modify the source code of srslte to achieve some custom function.
* To get confidence, because I haven't read a complicated open source project from the begining, and I want to be better, to be a professional, to be a self-discipliner.

### How do I do
* I am going to write the comments of the source code which I have read.
* I am going to share the manuscripts what I have drawn.
* I am goting to the above procedures everyday since 2019/1/25.

### srsLTE version
The source code version is srsLTE 18.12

### Explanation
* The source code of my project is just for reading, not for building, because I will delete some parts of it for some reasons.

Good luck with me~
